# Introducing to Machine Learning


## Decision Tree

* We will build a Decision Tree classifier, a powerful machine learnning technique for making data-driven decisions.
* Through the model, we will predict which type of Drug would a patient needs by the health parameters of the patient.

## Simple Linear Regression

* Linear regression is used to map the data points and form a regression line through them. With the line drawn, we can predict continues variables with the independent values
